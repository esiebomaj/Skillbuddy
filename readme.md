# skillBuddy

### A Messanger based AI (Wit.ai) powered app (chatbot). built using python/django frame-work

Willingness to learn a skill is common, but consistency in developing it remains lacking. Skill Buddy uses A.I to solve this problem and creates a community of learners for better self improvement.

## Inspiration
Large pool of young people in our country Nigeria who want to learn a skill but struggle with motivation and a seemingly lonely learning journey.

## What it does
Skill Buddy lends a helping hand by connecting skill enthusiasts to fellow learners and remind them of their daily goals.

## How I built it
Using wit.ai, we trained the chatbot. Then, we used python (Django framework) for the backend which was hosted on heroku. This app was then connected to messenger through our Facebook page for accessibility.

## Challenges I ran into
While we were building the app, we wanted to have a notification system that reminds our users on their daily learning goals this was not quite easy to do as we have not implemented anything quite like that before we were able to solve this problem using Celery

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Major accomplishment was getting to bring together different components (i.e. messenger, wit.ai, Django framework) and make the app run successfully

## What I learned
We learnt to use wit.ai. Learnt periodic tasks used celery in Django framework.

## What's next for Skill Buddy
Creating a real community of connected skill buddies and self improvement advocates.


## Deployment
The app was deployed using Heroku
